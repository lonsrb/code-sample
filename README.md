# code-sample
This repository exists solely to provide a sample of code I write professionally. 

The project implements a real estate listings page. The project uses MVVM driven off of the Swift Combine framework for view managment. 

The project *should* build and run just fine out of the box for you on a sim since we're using no 3rd party libs and not using any device specific hardware like cameras or accelerometers. 

The accompanying video walkthrough for this code sample is located here: [Codewalk through](https://youtu.be/gM_UFwuK0Tw)
